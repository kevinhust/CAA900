## Team Reflection

### What Worked Well

#### 1. Technology Choices
**FastAPI + React Architecture**: The combination of FastAPI for backend and React for frontend proved highly effective. FastAPI's automatic documentation generation and high performance complemented React's component-based architecture perfectly.

**Docker Development Environment**: The containerized development environment eliminated "works on my machine" problems and provided consistent development experience across the team.

**External API Integration**: Strategic integration with Adzuna and Google Maps APIs provided real-world data while maintaining system independence through comprehensive fallback mechanisms.

#### 2. Development Practices
**Documentation-Driven Development**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation throughout development helped team coordination and knowledge transfer.

**Incremental Development**: Breaking development into manageable phases allowed for continuous integration and early problem identification.

**Test-Driven Approach**: Writing tests alongside development improved code quality and caught issues early in the development cycle.

#### 3. Project Management
**Clear Architecture Planning**: Investing time upfront in architecture design paid dividends throughout development.

**Regular Code Reviews**: Peer review process improved code quality and knowledge sharing across the team.

**Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment processes reduced manual errors and improved development velocity.

### What Didn't Work

#### 1. Technology Challenges
**React 19 Adoption**: Attempting to use the latest React version caused compatibility issues that required rollback and rework.

**GraphQL Complexity**: Initial GraphQL implementation was overly complex and required simplification for maintainability.

**AWS Deployment Complexity**: Production AWS deployment proved more complex than anticipated, requiring significant time investment.

#### 2. Process Issues
**Initial Over-Engineering**: Early architecture was overly complex and required simplification for practical implementation.

**External API Dependencies**: Over-reliance on external APIs initially caused development delays when services were unavailable.

**Documentation Lag**: Documentation occasionally fell behind development, requiring catch-up efforts.

#### 3. Resource Constraints
**Time Management**: Some features required more development time than initially estimated.

**Learning Curve**: New technologies required additional learning time that impacted initial development velocity.

**Testing Resources**: Comprehensive testing required more time investment than initially planned.

### Lessons Learned

#### Technical Lessons
1. **Technology Maturity Matters**: Using proven, stable technology versions is often more valuable than bleeding-edge features.
2. **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Simple, well-implemented solutions often outperform complex architectures.
3. **External Dependencies**: Always plan for external API failures with comprehensive fallback systems.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Early performance considerations prevent costly refactoring later.
5. **Testing Investment**: Comprehensive testing upfront saves significant debugging time later.

#### Project Management Lessons
1. **Requirements Clarity**: Clear, detailed requirements prevent scope creep and development inefficiencies.
2. **Iterative Development**: Regular milestones and reviews catch issues early and maintain project momentum.
3. **Communication Importance**: Regular team communication prevents misunderstandings and coordination issues.
4. **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive documentation is an investment that pays dividends throughout the project lifecycle.
5. **Risk Management**: Identifying and planning for technical risks early prevents project delays.

#### Professional Development
1. **Modern Web Development**: Gained expertise in current web development technologies and practices.
2. **Cloud Architecture**: Learned practical cloud deployment and infrastructure management.
3. **API Design**: Developed skills in designing and implementing robust API architectures.
