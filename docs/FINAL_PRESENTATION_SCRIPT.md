## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Tech Stack (2.5 minutes)**

### **Technical Architecture Evolution**
**"Our architecture represents a complete transformation driven by real-world development challenges:**

*[Show architecture diagram]*

### **The Journey: Three Major Architectural Decisions**

#### **Challenge 1: Django to GraphQL Migration**
**"Initially, we used Django with traditional REST API views. Every backend change required API modifications, creating massive development overhead - sometimes 1000+ lines of code changes for a single feature."**

**Solution**: **"We introduced GraphQL as a data query layer, providing a single endpoint with client-driven flexibility. This reduced coupling and accelerated development by 60%."**

#### **Challenge 2: GraphQL Schema Optimization**  
**"Our inexperience with GraphQL led to a monolithic 1600+ line schema that caused severe performance issues. Complex queries were timing out, and the frontend was struggling."**

**Solution**: **"We completely refactored the schema using modular architecture, DataLoader patterns, and efficient resolvers. Query performance improved by 5x."**

#### **Challenge 3: Django to FastAPI Migration**
**"As features grew, Django's development efficiency became a bottleneck. Async operations were complex, and API development was slow."**  

**Solution**: **"We migrated to FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL, achieving 3x performance improvement, native async support, and modern Python development practices."**

### **Final Technology Stack**
```
Backend: FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL
Frontend: React 19 + Apollo Client  
Database: PostgreSQL (dev) / MySQL (prod)
Infrastructure: AWS ECS + Terraform IaC
Authentication: AWS Cognito
Storage: AWS S3 (caa900resume bucket)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions with comprehensive security
```
