## Slide 4: Technical Architecture Evolution Journey
### Three Major Architectural Decisions:

#### Challenge 1: Django REST API Coupling Issues
**Problem**: Django backend + REST API architecture required massive API view changes for every backend modification
**Impact**: Development inefficiency, single feature changes requiring 1000+ lines of code changes
**Solution**: Introduced GraphQL as data query layer, enabling client-driven flexible queries
**Result**: 60% development efficiency improvement, reduced API version management complexity

#### Challenge 2: GraphQL Schema Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Due to GraphQL inexperience, created a massive 1600+ line Schema
**Impact**: Severe query performance degradation, complex queries timing out
**Solution**: Modular architecture refactoring, DataLoader patterns, efficient resolvers
**Result**: 5x query performance improvement

#### Challenge 3: Django to FastAPI Migration
**Problem**: Django development efficiency became bottleneck, complex async operations, slow API development
**Solution**: Migrated to FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL
**Result**: 3x performance improvement, native async support, modern Python development practices

  jobs(filters: JobFilters): [Job]
  resumes(userId: ID!): [Resume]
  aiSuggestions(resumeId: ID): [AISuggestion]
}

type Mutation {
  createResume(input: ResumeInput!): Resume
  updateUser(input: UserInput!): User
  generateAISuggestions(resumeId: ID!): [AISuggestion]
}
```

## Slide 15: Q&A (Questions & Answers)
### Prepared Technical Questions:

**Q: "Why did you choose FastAPI over Django?"**
**A**: "Django became a bottleneck for our development velocity. FastAPI provides native async support, automatic API documentation, and modern Python type hints. We achieved 3x performance improvement and significantly faster development cycles."

**Q: "How do you handle GraphQL schema complexity?"**  
**A**: "We learned this lesson the hard way with our initial 1600-line schema. We refactored to modular architecture with separate types, queries, and mutations. We use DataLoader for efficient data fetching and Strawberry for type-safe Python GraphQL development."

**Q: "How do you ensure mobile performance?"**
**A**: "We built custom responsive hooks, implemented lazy loading, and optimized bundle sizes. Our PWA includes service worker caching and offline functionality. We achieve <2MB production builds and <200ms API response times."
